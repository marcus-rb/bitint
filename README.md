A JavaScript library for working with integers of sizes 8, 16, 32 and 64, signed and unsigned.

## Important notes
> this is still under development

## How it works
A set of methods and functions are defined and will soon be tied up to integer classes.
To create a new integer, declare a variable as **new int(" number ");**
